## Monthly Goals: June 2021

Process goal.

1. Bowsight is calibrated at 10 clicks per inch at 20yds, this comes out at 2 clicks per Minute Of Angle
2. To work on the timing of the shot with reference to when the hip and shoulder rotates into good alignment. Typically the hip and shoulder alignment rotates too early before the anchor is even close to the face, this affects posture as the archer will have a tendency to lean backwards to make room for the anchor hand to come into place. We changed the timing so that the shoulders and hip begin to rotate as the draw hand approaches the face approx 3/4 way through the draw to get the full rotation at the same time as the anchor comes into place. this maintains a straight line from draw elbow to hook and also keeps the archers weight in the correct place without leaning back to get the anchor into place, with good skeletal alignment.
3. To work on the balance of the shot, having the same pressure going forwards that you have coming back. Good focus on the pressure on the back wall v pressure going forwards into the bow hand.
