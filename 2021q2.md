# Goals


Adrians goals for the year, quarter and by month.


## Annual goal: October 2020 to October 2021

  * To shoot a comparable score in next years tournaments to those on our own field at 50 - 70m.
  * To shoot for the Bowman classification.



## Quarterly performance goal.

to improve on the pb's for

  * WA50=668
  * WA70=675
  * Frostbite=


## Monthly Goals: May 2021

Process goal.

  * To plot the sight adjustment on your sight 10 clicks at a time and record the movement at 20yds
  * To work on improving the use of core to stabilise the upper body. Posture to incorporate a positive hip rotation under the spine, the upper body has a tendency for the shoulders to collapse or curl forwards when the core is set and bow is raised and then again just before you commit to the draw the shoulders lower to brace for the draw weight.



Performance Goal.

  * To shoot a round 6 dozen on a 60cm face 10 zone scoring at 50yds (optically the same size as full size face at 100yds) to set a benchmark score.
  * Shoot a Gents long metric round, 3 dozen at 90m and 3 Dozen at 70m to set a benchmark score



Session goals:

  * To use deliberate practice at blank boss to work on posture that incorporates a positive hip rotation to get the hips under the spine, to use a tapered approach to drawing the bow so that it is more controllable thus allowing improved use of core. Score rounds at 50-70m, to tie in with sasha's practice at 70m re covid rules.

  * running out of vanes in may, will need to replace.

# Practice Journal


## 2021 May 02 Sunday

Long Metric baseline score today, 587.

Lots of 6s during the first part at 90m, not normal.

First 3 dozen at 90 m were frustrating. large sight setting changes from the start, took most of the round to get it right. Took a much more agressive stance on the 70m round and raised the sight significantly more than the last marks, felt much more confident.

Feel like my 90m performance today was significantly below my norm. Looking forward to the next time.
