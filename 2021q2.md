## 2021 May 02 Sunday

Long Metric baseline score today, 587.

Lots of 6s during the first part, not normal.

First 3 dozen at 90 m were frustrating. large sight setting changes from the start, took most of the round to get it right. Took a much more agressive stance on the 70m round and raised the sight significantly more than the last marks, felt much more confident.

Feel like my 90m performance today was significantly below my norm. Looking forward to the next time.
