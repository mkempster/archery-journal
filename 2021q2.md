# 2021 Quarter 2, Apr to June


# Goals

Adrian's goals for the year, quarter and by month.

## Annual goal: October 2020 to October 2021

  * To shoot a comparable score in next years tournaments to those on our own field at 50 - 70m.
  * To shoot for the Bowman classification.

  * (Bowman for Long Metric/compound is 602.)

## Quarterly performance goal.

to improve on the pb's for

  * WA50=668
  * WA70=675
  * Frostbite=


## Monthly Goals: May 2021

Process goal.

  * To plot the sight adjustment on your sight 10 clicks at a time and record the movement at 20yds
  * To work on improving the use of core to stabilise the upper body. Posture to incorporate a positive hip rotation under the spine, the upper body has a tendency for the shoulders to collapse or curl forwards when the core is set and bow is raised and then again just before you commit to the draw the shoulders lower to brace for the draw weight.



Performance Goal.

  * To shoot a round 6 dozen on a 60cm face 10 zone scoring at 50yds (optically the same size as full size face at 100yds) to set a benchmark score.
  * Shoot a Gents long metric round, 3 dozen at 90m and 3 Dozen at 70m to set a benchmark score



Session goals:

  * To use deliberate practice at blank boss to work on posture that incorporates a positive hip rotation to get the hips under the spine, to use a tapered approach to drawing the bow so that it is more controllable thus allowing improved use of core. Score rounds at 50-70m, to tie in with sasha's practice at 70m re covid rules.

  * 90m 58.7
  * 70m 43.7
  * 50m

# Equipment Changes


  * regular crazy glue for vanes, not specialty archery glue. so far seems to be working fine.
  * go back to aae max from trying out spinwings.
  * running out of vanes in may, will need to replace.
  * made bowstring doing ok, next one needs some material changes to be better.


# Practice Journal


## 2021 May 02 Sunday

Long Metric baseline score today, 587.

Lots of 6s during the first part at 90m, not normal.

First 3 dozen at 90 m were frustrating. large sight setting changes from the start, took most of the round to get it right. Took a much more agressive stance on the 70m round and raised the sight significantly more than the last marks, felt much more confident.

Feel like my 90m performance today was significantly below my norm. Looking forward to the next time.

## 2021 May 07 Friday

Round: WA70 (70m, 122cm face)
Score: 624
Arrow Count: 95
  practice end, 6 dozen for score, 2 dozen after.
Sight mark: 43.7
  Lowered a whole integer from last 70m mark. Strange that it keeps moving around over the past few weeks.

Focus

  * Hips under, engaging core per Aunty Lucy, without curving shoulders.
  * Pay attention to leaning (not too much)

Notes

  * Felt like I shot ok, but way off my PB for this round. Curious.
  * Had some unfocused rounds, but even so, significantly below. Wonder if my PB is a mistake.
  * Left shoulder getting tired at the end, reaching volume of 8 and 9 dozen.
  * Indicates the end of my volume and where to orient periodicity training.
  * Also indicates collapsing of form during the Prepare phase, normally for me this is a rounding of shoulders.
  * Volume of 6 dozen felt fine. 8 dozen began to have form difficulty.

## 2021 May 9 Sunday

Round: 60cm face at 50 yd (half-value 100 yd York simulation)
Score: 574
Arrow Count: 95
  Practice ends, 6 dozen for score, dozen and a half after.
  Didn't realize this was the same arrow count as last time. Meant to be less to work on 8 dozen in Periodization plan.
Sight Mark: 27.2

Focus

  * Hips under, good core.

Notes

  * Little bit of cross breeze today, maybe 9-12 mph at times.
  * Arrows consistently out to the right today.
  * Attribute to leaning too far to the right (on toes), which (apparently) continues to plague me.
  * Ends 1-3: Hard to settle today when at anchor. Not sure what I'm missing, but things don't feel as connected as they normally do.
  * Ends 4-7: pretty good groups, just right of center. Mostly correct height at least.
  * Noticed towards the end I was slouching today. Groups improved when I got back to Prepare phase with a more upright body.
  * Had some REALLY AMAZING groups of 3 and 4 arrows all touching each other, but they were off center.
  * Last 4 ends or so, more arrows felt simpler to execute. 4 out of 6 I felt solid and confident. The other 2 were shaky or I know I made a mistake. Overall feels good to settle in to latest version of Prepare phase.
